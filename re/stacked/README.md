## Description

This program asks for a password. Can you get it? The binary looks stacked.

## Solution

Look at the binary using Ghidra, IDA, or any other disassembler. Find what strings are used to build the password or what string is used to print the flag.

The password is: `4w3s0m3_fl4gs_th3_fl4g_l00k1ng_for!}`

Flag is: `DSC{y3s_y0u_f0und_wh3r3_we_w3nt_t0}`
