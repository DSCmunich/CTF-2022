## Description
We have identified a shady CTF writeup website. We suspect that the site is being used by malicious actors to commit flag fraud and flag sharing. We need to act against this website, however we do not have any proof. We captured an immage that might be related to illegal activities, but the malicious actor is using a commercial content protector to obfuscate the communication. Unfortunately, we lost all our money in the latest shitcoin scam, so we can't afford buying the protector. All we got was the trial version, which only works on the demo image. Can you crack the content protector and help us restoring the integrity of CTFs?
